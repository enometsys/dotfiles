# # Configuring GPG Agent Forwarding (for using local gpg keys) and ssh forwarding (for using local ssh keys)
# 1. Find out where the extra socket of the GPG agent is on your local system:
#   ```sh
#   $ gpgconf --list-dirs agent-extra-socket
#   /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.extra
#   ```
# 2. Find out where the agent socket is on the remote system:
#   ```sh
#   $ gpgconf --list-dirs agent-socket
#   /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent
#   ```
# 3. Add the following configuration parameter to your SSH server configuration (/etc/ssh/sshd_config):
#   ```
#   StreamLocalBindUnlink yes
#   ```
# 4. Edit the SSH configuration in ~/.ssh/config on the local machine to forward the socket to the remote machine:
#   ```
#   Host remote
#     RemoteForward <remote socket> <local socket>
#   ```
# 5. The public key suitable for the YubiKey must also be present on the target system. 
#    For simplicity, we can copy the local collection of public keys to the remote machine:
#   ```sh
#   $ scp .gnupg/pubring.kbx remote:~/.gnupg/
#   ```

# - Run gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
# - Use ps ax | grep gpg-agent to find and kill all of the pids.
# - Reconnect ssh session to re-establish the socket forwarding.

# - problems may occur if the gnupg versions are different between local and remote machines. 
#   Therefore you should check that the versions are the same or at least not too different.
